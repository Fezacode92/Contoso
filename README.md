# Flask-framework

Flask App
This repository contains a Flask-based web application that showcases the development of a dynamic and interactive web application using the Flask framework.

Features
User-friendly web interface powered by Flask.
Flexible routing system for handling different URL endpoints.
Template engine for creating dynamic HTML pages.
Integration with a database (optional) for data storage and retrieval.
Implementation of RESTful APIs for data manipulation (optional).
Customizable styles and layouts using CSS or front-end frameworks.
Installation
To run the Flask app locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended) using the command:
shell
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:
On macOS and Linux:
shell
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
On Windows:
shell
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies:
shell
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask app:
shell
Copy code
flask run
Access the app in your web browser at http://localhost:5000.
Usage
Once the Flask app is running, you can interact with it through the web interface. Explore the different URL endpoints to access various pages and functionalities provided by the app. You can customize the existing routes or create new ones to meet your specific application requirements.

The templates directory contains HTML templates that define the structure and layout of the web pages. Modify these templates to change the appearance of the app or add dynamic content using Flask's template engine.

The app.py file contains the Flask application code, including route definitions, database connections (if applicable), and business logic. Modify this file to add new routes, database functionality, API endpoints, or other application-specific logic.
